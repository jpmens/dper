====

The DNS Peering Protocol (dper) is an initiative to create a simple way of
exchanging zones for entities running secondary DNS for each other.

Data is exchanged via some undefined mechanism (e.g. HTTPS) via a predefined
format (the dper XML schema). There is also a script provided than can convert
dper XML data to BIND and NSD configuration files.
